## 🕰️ Historical Context of the Czech Air Force Airbus A319 Fleet

The Czech Air Force operates a pair of Airbus A319CJ (Corporate Jetliner) aircraft, specifically tailored for VIP and governmental transport. These aircraft represent a significant modernization step for the Air Force’s fleet.

## 📥 Delivery & Fleet Renewal

The first A319CJ (tail number 2801) was delivered on 30 January 2007, ferrying from Airbus in Hamburg to Prague–Kbely, marking a fresh era in VIP transport. The second aircraft arrived in October 2007, bringing the total to two in service. These aircraft replaced older Tupolev Tu‑154M transports, streamlining the fleet for official use.

## 🎯 About A319CJ and its capabilities

Designed as short- to medium-range transport jets, the A319CJ accommodates VVIP passengers, such as government officials, heads of state, and other dignitaries. Powered by two CFMI CFM56 engines, the interior layout varies by the customer misson, capable of carrying 10–43 passengers in luxury or up to 124 in standard configuration, with additional fuel tanks significantly extending its range. Under the 24th Transport Air Base at Prague–Kbely, these aircraft serve state-priority flights, including presidential and ministerial transport, as well as air ambulance and SAR operations.

## 🌍 Missions & Use Cases

Regularly used for governmental and state flights, both domestic and international—including fact: President Petr Pavel traveled to New Zealand and Australia aboard tail number 3085 in December 2024. Deployed for evacuation and repatriation missions, such as transporting Czech citizens from conflict zones—most recently from Israel and Gaza in June 2025.
